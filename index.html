            <p class="floatLeft">Hi, my name is Chad Kaplan. I am an aspiring coder. I grew up in Coral Springs,
                Florida
                and have lived in
                the sunshine state my entire life. I grew up playing basketball, volleyball, playing a lot of
                video games, and petting every dog I can get my hands on. After graduating high school, I moved
                to
                Orlando for college at UCF in the Fall of 2011,
                where I
                earned a bachelor’s degree in communication sciences and disorders. When I continued on to
                graduate
                school in pursuit of my master’s degree to become a speech-language pathologist, I started to
                discover
                more about myself and the aspects of a career that I find appealing or repelling. I ended up
                leaving
                the
                program in pursuit of a more fulfilling field for me.</p>
            <br>
            <p> It wasn’t until recently that I discovered how my interests coincide with coding and how I could
                see
                myself writing lines of code for a living and never calling it “work”. I have always loved
                technology
                but have never been extremely knowledgeable on the subject outside of the norm of “millennial
                tech
                savvy
                skills”. I have always been able to bet on my intelligence to be able to learn any skill or
                subject
                I
                want, however; I have not always been good at knowing what I should learn. Throughout the UCF
                Coding
                Bootcamp I hope to acquire the skills to become a competent coder in order to get a job that I
                enjoy
                doing every day.</p>
